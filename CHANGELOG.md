# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
Dates are omitted for pre-1.0 releases that predate this changelog and were
reconstructed from git history.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- Pre-filter regexes are word-bounded: `java` no longer rejects "JavaScript", `test` no longer rejects "Latest"/"Contest", `intern` no longer rejects "Internal", `india` no longer accepts "Indianapolis". Also handles `Back-end`, `Full-Stack`, `NodeJS`, `SDE2`, `Sr.`, `Internship`, `.NET`, `C#`.
- Gemini scoring failures are no longer stored as `score=0`/`scored`; the job stays `discovered` and is retried next scan.
- Jobs are marked `notified` only when Telegram returns HTTP 200; otherwise `scored`.
- Scorer now uses `gemini_model` from config/env and passes the candidate profile into the scoring prompt (previously hardcoded model, no profile).
- Placeholder Telegram values (`YOUR_…`, `…_here`) are treated as unconfigured — no more HTTP 404 sends.
- Direct-scanner tests no longer make real HTTP calls to api.telegram.org.

### Changed
- Dedupe treats only `scored`/`notified` as final: `skipped` rows are re-run through the pre-filter and `discovered` rows are re-scored.
- `TINYFISH_API_KEY` is optional (`draft` raises a clear error without it). `llm_provider` defaults to `gemini`; OpenRouter is deprecated and logs a warning.
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` accepted as an alias for `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`.
- Harvester probes the ATS declared in `india.yml` first, applies `validator.KNOWN_CORRECTIONS`, and tags other-ATS matches with `ats_fallback_from`.
- Pre-filter title include list adds `Product/Platform/Infrastructure/Systems Engineer`.
- Location filter: remote roles tied to another region (US/UK/EU/LATAM, US cities, `, CA`-style state codes) are rejected unless India is also listed; `worldwide/anywhere/global` and geography-free remote pass; Mumbai and Chennai added. `.gitignore` adds `scratchpad/`; ARCHITECTURE.md rewritten for the direct-ATS pipeline.
- Workday adapter searches `searchText="India"`, paginates up to 100 jobs (20/page), keeps earlier pages if a later page fails, and resolves "N Locations" items (plus description) via the job detail endpoint.
- Harvester no longer drops companies on LinkedIn headcount (cache is stale, e.g. Sigmoid tagged 11-50); headcount is badge metadata only.
- `companies.json` curated to 28 boards, each verified to have live jobs from the right employer.
- `.gitignore` adds `data/` and `*.pdf`; CLAUDE.md rewritten for the direct-ATS + Gemini pipeline.

### Added
- Comprehensive architecture and future roadmap guide ([`ARCHITECTURE.md`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/ARCHITECTURE.md)) detailing high-level design, data flow, component breakdown, testing invariants, and multi-milestone expansion plan (multi-channel alerts, direct ATS scrapers, granular scoring, web dashboard, interview prep).
- Local runtime and toolchain bootstrap: Python 3.12 virtual environment, `uv` dependency management, full dev/mcp/claude dependencies installed.
- Added dedicated Google Gemini LLM provider using `google-genai` SDK:
  - Settings parser and [`job_hunt/config.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/config.py) accept `GEMINI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_MODEL` (defaulting to `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`).
  - Provider dispatch in [`job_hunt/llm_utils.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/llm_utils.py) and scoring in [`job_hunt/scanner.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/scanner.py).
  - Strict JSON output formatting (`{"score": <0-100>, "reason": "<one sentence explanation>"}`) via `response_mime_type="application/json"`.
  - Graceful fallback returning `{"score": 0, "reason": "Scoring failed"}` on API or parsing failures to guarantee the scan loop never crashes.
- **Module 1 (Native Direct ATS Adapters)**:
  - Added zero-browser HTTP fetching adapters under [`job_hunt/adapters/`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/adapters/):
    - Greenhouse (`boards-api.greenhouse.io` and `boards.eu.greenhouse.io`)
    - Lever (`api.lever.co/v0/postings`)
    - Ashby HQ (`api.ashbyhq.com/posting-api/job-board`)
    - SmartRecruiters (`api.smartrecruiters.com/v1/companies/{slug}/postings`)
    - Workday Client CXS API (`{tenant}.{dc}.myworkdayjobs.com/wday/cxs/...`)
    - Recruitee (`{slug}.recruitee.com/api/offers`)
    - Personio (`{slug}.jobs.personio.de/xml?language=en`)
  - Intelligent ATS auto-detection from company URLs (`detect_ats`).
- **Module 2 (SQLite Deduplication & Local Regex Pre-Filter)**:
  - Unified canonical schema [`JobPosting`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/models.py) with deterministic MD5 canonical hashing and URL hashing.
  - Persistent SQLite database at `data/jobs.db` ([`job_hunt/db.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/db.py)) tracking `discovered`, `skipped`, `scored`, and `notified` status.
  - Local regex pre-filter ([`job_hunt/prefilter.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/prefilter.py)) to drop non-matching titles, excluded seniorities, and unsupported locations before sending to LLM.
- **Gemini Scoring & Rate Throttling**:
  - Unified scoring pipeline ([`job_hunt/scorer.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/scorer.py)) with 4.2-second sleep pacing to strictly respect 15 RPM cap.
  - Automatic Telegram alert triggers for jobs matching score threshold (>= 70).
- **Task 1: Ingest Local Data & Build `companies.json`**:
  - Implemented [`job_hunt/company_builder.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/company_builder.py) extracting Indian tech companies from `india.yml`.
  - Matched company names against `companyCache` in `linkedin-size-filter-backup-2026-10-03.json`.
  - Applied Safety Blocklist: safely discarded only companies explicitly tagged as `1-10 employees` or `11-50 employees`, while retaining all larger tiers (`51-200`, `201-500`, `501-1,000`, `1,001-5,000`, `5,001-10,000`, `10,001+ employees`) and unlisted/unknown entries.
  - Generated deduplicated `companies.json` with 249 companies across Ashby, Greenhouse, Lever (with Workday support).
- **Task 2: Notification Badges (`job_hunt/notifier.py`)**:
  - Added `format_job_alert` to [`job_hunt/notifier.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/notifier.py) embedding company headcount badge:
    `🏢 <b>Company:</b> {company} 🏷️ <i>[{headcount}]</i>`.
  - Integrated badge with [`JobPosting`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/models.py) model and [`job_hunt/scorer.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/scorer.py).
- **Task 3: Lightweight Diagnostics (`autopilot doctor`)**:
  - Implemented single-file diagnostics module in [`job_hunt/doctor.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/doctor.py) runnable via `autopilot doctor` or `python -m job_hunt doctor`.
  - Verifies SQLite write permissions on `data/jobs.db`.
  - Confirms Gemini quota health with 1-token test prompt (`gemini-3.5-flash-lite`).
  - Verifies Telegram bot credentials via `getMe`.
  - Pings sample network egress endpoints for Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, and Workday.
  - Outputs a clean pass/fail checklist to terminal.
- **Task 4: Daily Runner Script (`run_daily.sh`)**:
  - Created executable [`run_daily.sh`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/run_daily.sh) for automated execution.
  - Appends timestamped logs to `data/scan.log`.
  - Sets default alert threshold to score >= 70.
  - Forwards CLI parameters (e.g. `--limit 5`).
- **Slug Validation & Active Board Pruning (`job_hunt/validator.py`)**:
  - Implemented concurrent ATS endpoint validator ([`job_hunt/validator.py`](file:///home/user/codes/random_projects/JobNotify/job_hunt/validator.py)) with CLI command `autopilot validate` / `python -m job_hunt validator`.
  - Applied known corrections for Razorpay (`greenhouse`, `razorpaysoftwareprivatelimited`), Freshworks (`smartrecruiters`, `freshworks`), BrowserStack (`workday`, `browserstack`), and Slice.
  - Pruned all inactive/404/403 endpoints, leaving `companies.json` with 10 verified active company boards.
- **ATS Adapter Resiliency**:
  - Updated all direct ATS adapters to intercept HTTP 404 responses and log at `DEBUG` level instead of printing warning stack traces, keeping scans clean and readable.

## [0.4.4] — 2026-07-09

### Added
- Job discovery search query is now config-driven: `candidate.search_seniority`
  / `candidate.search_keywords` in `config.json` shape the `site:<domain>`
  query sent to TinyFish per company. Empty/absent falls back to the previous
  hardcoded senior/staff ML/DS terms, so existing configs behave identically.
  Closes #24.

### Fixed
- `job_hunt/__init__.py` `__version__` re-synced with `pyproject.toml` (had
  drifted to a stale `0.4.1` across the last two releases).

## [0.4.3] — 2026-07-05

### Added
- MCP tools now ship full metadata: per-tool `ToolAnnotations` (title, readOnly/
  destructive/idempotent/openWorld hints), per-parameter descriptions via
  `Annotated[..., Field(...)]`, and structured output schemas (FastMCP auto).
  Improves registry quality scoring and host UX.

### Changed
- `mcp` extra now requires `mcp>=1.9` (ToolAnnotations support).

## [0.4.2] — 2026-07-05

> Note: 0.4.1 was recorded here but never uploaded to PyPI (latest there was 0.4.0);
> 0.4.2 supersedes it everywhere (PyPI, MCP registries).

### Added
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker + `Typing :: Typed` and explicit Python 3.11/3.12/3.13
  classifiers on PyPI.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` — checklist including the drafts-only invariant.
- README: `mcp-name` ownership marker (Official MCP Registry) and registry-status line.

## [0.4.1] — 2026-07-03

### Added
- CI hardening: Python 3.13 in the test matrix, pip caching, and a `gitleaks`
  secret-scan job.
- Formal test scaffold: `pytest.ini` and a shared `conftest.py` (`fake_llm`,
  `clean_env`, `sample_config`, `sample_job` fixtures).
- Coverage gate (`--cov=job_hunt`, `fail_under = 85`) plus a mocked test suite
  raising coverage from ~36% to ~90%.
- `mypy` type checking with `job_hunt/` fully annotated; enforced in CI.
- GitHub issue templates (bug report, feature request).
- `skills/autopilot-jobhunt/SKILL.md` — a Claude Code usage skill that drives the hunt
  via the MCP tools.
- MCP registry manifests: `server.json` (official MCP Registry) and `smithery.yaml`.
- `autopilot mcp` subcommand to launch the stdio MCP server from the installed console
  script.
- `autopilot-jobhunt` console-script alias (== the PyPI distribution name) so
  MCP-registry runners that derive the command from the package name resolve
  correctly.
- `docs/` guide set: install, providers, API keys, scanning, integrations, MCP,
  config/scoring, troubleshooting, and a testing checklist.
- `SECURITY.md`, `PRIVACY.md`, and this `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Fixed
- `job_hunt/__init__.py` `__version__` corrected from a stale `0.1.0` to track the
  packaged version.

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- `glama.json` for Glama MCP ownership/indexing and a Glama quality badge.
- `Dockerfile` and OCI image labels for the Glama MCP listing and ghcr package linking.
- Demo GIF and star CTA in the README.
- `LOG_LEVEL` env honored for console verbosity.

### Changed
- Scanner always saves results to CSV and logs a provider-aware startup line.

## [0.3.1]

### Fixed
- Compose `config.json` and `.env` correctly (placeholder guard so the default `.env`
  template no longer clobbers real config values).
- `export` works without API keys (reads local scan state only).
- Added per-request timeouts to OpenRouter and Anthropic calls.
- Handle both dict and list JSON shapes from the Claude CLI output.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- `claude_cli` LLM provider (score/draft via the local `claude` CLI, no API key).

## [0.2.0]

### Added
- pip-install workflow with `autopilot init` scaffolding.
- Structured logging and CSV fallback when Telegram send fails.
- Anthropic/Claude as an optional LLM provider.
- `SETUP.md` and `CLAUDE.md`.

### Changed
- Renamed the package and repository to `autopilot-jobhunt`.

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial open-source release: nightly careers-page scan, LLM resume scoring,
  Telegram alerts, and on-demand resume + cover-letter drafting.
